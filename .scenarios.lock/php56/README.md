IMPORTANT:

This scenario was created a long time ago, with Composer 1.  It is not
possible to test PHP 5.6 with Composer 2, because versions of Drupal old
enough to work on PHP 5.6 only work with Composer 1. Therefore, this
scenario is no longer managed by Composer Test Scenarios.

Leave it as it is!  :)
